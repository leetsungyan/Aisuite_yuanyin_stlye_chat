# Project Context

## Purpose
This project creates a "Lucky Vicky" style positive thinking generator using AI. It takes negative or unfortunate events and rephrases them in an overly positive, social media post format, emphasizing how lucky the situation is.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.13
- aisuite (for unified AI API access)
- gradio (for web UI)
- groq (for AI model access)

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- Use UTF-8 encoding
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guide
- Use descriptive variable names in English
- Include docstrings for functions

### Architecture Patterns
- Simple script-based architecture
- Modular functions for AI interaction
- Web UI via Gradio for user interaction

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing of AI responses
- Validate API key setup
- Test web interface functionality

### Git Workflow
- Use main branch for stable code
- Create feature branches for changes
- Commit messages in English

## Domain Context
- AI-powered content generation
- Positive psychology reframing
- Social media post formatting
- Taiwanese language and culture (responses in traditional Chinese)

## Important Constraints
- Requires valid API keys for AI services
- Internet connection needed for AI calls
- Local execution with Python virtual environment

## External Dependencies
- Groq API for AI model access
- Gradio for web interface hosting
